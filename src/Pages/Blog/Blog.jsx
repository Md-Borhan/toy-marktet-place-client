            What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and
            where should we store them on the client-side?
          </h3>
          <p>
            an access token is used to access protected resources, while a
            refresh token is used to obtain a new access token when the current
            one expires, without requiring the user to reauthenticate. Both
            tokens play a crucial role in maintaining secure and seamless
            authentication and authorization in applications.
            <br />
            You can store tokens in browser storage mechanisms such as
            localStorage or sessionStorage. Another option is to store tokens as
            HTTP-only cookies.

            Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>SQL Database:</strong> SQL databases follow a structured,
            tabular data model, where data is organized into tables with
            predefined schemas. SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning
            they can handle increasing workloads by adding more resources to a
            single server.This databases use the SQL query language for data
            manipulation and retrieval.SQL databases are well-suited for
            applications that require complex querying, strict data consistency,
            and well-defined schemas, such as transactional systems, financial
            applications, and reporting.
            <br />
            <strong>NoSQL Database:</strong> NoSQL databases use various data
            models, such as key-value pairs, document, columnar, or graph. They
            offer flexible schemas that allow for dynamic and unstructured
            data.NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable,
            allowing them to distribute data across multiple servers. This
            databases use various query languages specific to their data
            models.NoSQL databases are suitable for scenarios with large-scale
            data, high traffic loads, and where flexibility and scalability are
            essential.

            What is express js? What is Nest JS?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Express JS:</strong> Express is a node js web application
            framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile
            applications.It used build a single page, multi page and hybrid web
            application.It is a layer build on the top of the Node JS that helps
            manage servers and routes.
            <br />
            <strong>Nest JS: </strong>
            NestJS is a powerful, progressive, and TypeScript-based framework
            for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It is
            built on top of Node.js and utilizes modern JavaScript features and
            design patterns. NestJS combines elements from both object-oriented
            programming (OOP), functional programming (FP), and modular
            architecture to provide a robust and flexible platform for
            developing server-side applications.

            What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a
            collection by means of passing them through different stages. The
            stages make up what is known as a pipeline. The stages in a pipeline
            can filter, sort, group, reshape and modify documents that pass
            through the pipeline.
